## Server Integration:

This web application is designed to work with a server-side script that handles the search functionality and provides recipe data in response to search queries. The server-side script should accept GET requests with search parameters and return JSON data containing an array of recipes matching the search query.

## Testing

### Jest Test Cases

I've included a comprehensive suite of Jest test cases to ensure the reliability and functionality of the application. These tests cover various aspects of the codebase, including unit tests for individual functions, integration tests for components, and end-to-end tests for critical user flows.

To run the Jest test suite, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine.
2. Navigate to the root directory of the project in your terminal.
3. Run the command `npm test` or `yarn test`.
4. Jest will execute all the test cases and provide a detailed report of the results.

Feel free to explore the `__tests__` directory to view the test files and examine the testing strategies employed throughout the project. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for additional test cases, please don't hesitate to open an issue or submit a pull request.
